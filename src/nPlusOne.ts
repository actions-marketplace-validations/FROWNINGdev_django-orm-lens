/**
 * Schema-aware support for DOL007 (possible N+1 inside a for-loop).
 *
 * Why this module exists
 * ----------------------
 * DOL007 used to be pure text shape: `for x in <queryset>:` followed by any
 * `x.<attr>` in the body. That fires on a local column, an inherited Python
 * property, and even a foreign key the very same statement already covered
 * with `.select_related()` — reported as issue #85, with four reproducers.
 * The practical result is that the rule has to be disabled workspace-wide,
 * which also loses the true positives it exists to catch.
 *
 * The Python CLI gets this right by construction: `NPlusOneScanner._classify`
 * resolves the attribute against the parsed schema and skips a declared
 * non-relational field, and `_chain_prefetch_args` skips a relation the chain
 * already prefetches. Per the parser-parity contract the CLI is the reference
 * and the TypeScript side is what lags, so this module ports those two gates
 * rather than inventing a third set of semantics.
 *
 * The two gates are deliberately independent
 * ------------------------------------------
 * Gate 2 (already covered by the chain) needs no schema at all — it is pure
 * string matching against `.select_related(...)` arguments — so it applies
 * even on a cold start, and on its own it fixes the case where the rule
 * contradicts code that has already taken its advice. Gate 1 (scalar) needs
 * the workspace index and stays off without one. That split is why this is
 * not a single `if (index)` branch.
