# Changelog

All notable changes to Django ORM Lens will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Simplified Chinese rule index.** The existing `DOL021` and `DOL022`
  translations now have a dedicated partial-locale index linked from the
  Chinese README. Refs #81.

- **Italian translations for the model-definition rules.** The documentation
  for `DOL011` through `DOL015` is now available in Italian, with a dedicated
  index linked from the complete rule reference. Refs #52.

- **Italian translations for the queryset rules.** The documentation for
  `DOL001` through `DOL008` is now available in Italian and linked from the
  locale index. Refs #98.

### Fixed

- **DOL007 no longer fires on attribute accesses that cost nothing.**
  [#85](https://github.com/FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens/issues/85) reported four
  loops the extension flagged and the CLI left alone: a local column, a
  foreign key the same statement had already covered with `.select_related()`,
  a `@property` inherited from an abstract base, and a column on an annotated
  queryset. The rule fired on essentially every list-and-print loop, so the
  practical response was to disable it workspace-wide — which also costs the
  true positives it exists to catch.

  The cause was that DOL007 was pure line shape while the CLI's `nplusone`
  analyzer has always been schema-aware. Per the parser-parity contract the
  CLI is the reference, so its two gates were ported rather than a third set
  of semantics invented: an attribute the schema declares as a plain field is
  skipped, as is one a *known* model does not declare at all — which is what a
  property looks like from the outside — and a relation the chain already
  spans is skipped.

  The gates are independent, which matters more than it sounds. The coverage
  gate needs no schema, so it holds during a cold start, and on its own it
  fixes the case where the rule contradicted code that had already taken its
  advice. The scalar gate needs the workspace index and stays off without one,
  so a pass that runs before the first scan finishes behaves as it did before
  instead of reporting from a schema it does not have. A model missing from
  the index is never read as "scalar", so a partial scan cannot silence real
  findings.

  Verified against the reference rather than against the report: on the
  reporter's four cases the CLI prints `No N+1 anti-patterns detected` and the
  extension now returns zero findings on the same files.

- **Diagnostics recomputed on every keystroke had no schema.**
  `onDidChangeTextDocument` was the one refresh path that did not pass the
  workspace index, so schema-aware rules ran with their gates off during
  editing — the path that produces nearly every diagnostic a user actually
  sees. Three of the four false positives above survived the fix until this
  was corrected, which is why it is listed separately.

  The QuickFix provider had the same gap from the other side: it re-runs a
  single rule to recover a finding's `fixHint` and matches by exact range, but
  it re-ran without the index the diagnostics were produced with. Once a rule
  returns different findings with and without a schema, that match fails and
  the fix silently stops being offered — a bug that reads as a missing
  feature. The provider now takes the same index getter.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- **DOL008 — a lookup name that looks misspelled.** Point 4 of the original
  [#3](https://github.com/FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens/issues/3) sketch, and the
  last of it. `Post.objects.filter(titel="x")` is flagged with `title` as the
  suggestion, and a QuickFix replaces exactly that segment, so
  `author__emial` becomes `author__email` rather than losing its prefix.

  Django raises `FieldError` for a bad lookup name, but only when the queryset
  is evaluated — which for a filter inside a branch may be in production
  rather than in a test.

  The rule waited three releases on purpose. A completion that stays silent
  when unsure costs nothing; an error squiggle that is wrong when unsure puts
  a red underline on correct code and teaches people to turn the extension
  off. Two properties hold the precision, and both are structural rather than
  tuned:

  **It cannot fire on anything completion would offer.** The check asks the
  completion resolver for the names valid at that position and reports only
  what is missing from that list — the same resolver, not a weaker second copy
  that would drift from it. Inherited fields, cross-file bases, reverse
  accessors, `pk` and per-type lookups are all covered for free, which is
  exactly why this needed v0.15.0, v0.16.0 and v0.17.0 to land first. Shipped
  earlier it would have underlined `Author.objects.filter(posts__title=...)`,
  which is ordinary Django.

  **It only fires when there is a near match to name.** "I do not recognise
  this" is a low-precision claim — annotations, custom lookups and unparsed
  mixins all land there. "This looks like a misspelling of that" is a
  high-precision one and comes with something actionable. One edit of slack for
  names of four characters or fewer, two for longer; the first character must
  match, since that is the letter people get right even when they fumble the
  rest.

  It stays silent entirely on a line carrying `.annotate()`, `.alias()` or
  `.extra()`, on arguments containing a nested call such as `Q(...)`, when the
  model does not resolve, and past the first unrecognised segment of a path.
  The fix is `suggestion`, never auto-applied: however close the spelling, the
  suggestion is a guess about intent, and renaming a lookup unattended could
  change what a query returns.

### Changed

- **`RuleContext` can carry the parsed workspace.** Optional, because most
  rules are pure text shape — `.count() > 0` needs no schema — and because the
  rule pass must still run before the first scan completes. A rule that needs
  the schema returns nothing when it is absent rather than guessing, so a cold
  start is quiet rather than wrong.

- **One Levenshtein implementation instead of two.** Extracted to
  `src/textDistance.ts` when the typo detector became a second caller. Two
  independent copies is how "the rename detector and the typo detector
  disagree about what counts as close" becomes a bug nobody can reproduce.

- **The fixer registry test derives rule codes from the rules.** It held a
  hand-kept list of code strings and failed on DOL008 for no better reason
  than that nobody had added the string to it — noise that says nothing about
  whether a fixer points at a real rule, which is the only thing the test is
  for.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **The TypeScript parser now resolves inheritance the way the Python CLI
  already did** ([#84](https://github.com/FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens/issues/84)).
  v0.16.0 taught it that a subclass of a local model is a model, with a single
  backward pass. Comparing the result against `cli/django_orm_lens/parser.py`
  afterwards showed that side had solved the same problem years-of-commits
  earlier and solved more of it, so the two implementations disagreed. Five
  gaps, closed together:

  1. **Fixed point instead of source order.** `resolveAndFilter` iterates until
     nothing changes, so `class Post(TimeStamped)` written *above* its base
     resolves. The v0.16.0 notes claimed source order was safe because "Python
     requires the base to be defined before the subclass" — that is untrue once
     the base is imported, and the Python implementation never relied on it.

  2. **Bases in another file.** `scanWorkspace` now collects every definition
     first and resolves the union once, matching `scan_workspace`. A project
     keeping its abstract bases in `core/models.py` — the usual place — used to
     lose every model that inherits from one.

  3. **`abstract_models.py` is read.** Pluggable frameworks keep abstract bases
     there and leave `models.py` holding only concrete subclasses; django-oscar
     does this in all 14 of its apps. The glob and the directory walk both
     cover it now, as `MODEL_SOURCE_FILES` already did on the Python side.

  4. **Abstract models are dropped.** They have no table, so a schema tool has
     nothing to show for them. This is a visible change: an abstract base that
     used to appear in the sidebar and the ER diagram no longer does. It is
     what the CLI has always done, and one behaviour is better than two.

  5. **`ParsedModel.inheritedFields`.** Fields reaching a model from its
     abstract bases are exposed as their own list, each carrying
     `inheritedFrom`, rather than being merged into `fields` at the point of
     use. Only abstract bases contribute: a concrete parent is multi-table
     inheritance, where the columns stay on the parent's table and copying them
     onto the child would invent columns no migration will ever create.

- **The parity fixture had no local base class in it.** `test/parity.test.js`
  and `cli/tests/test_parity.py` assert against one shared fixture, which is
  the right design — but `parity_input.py` contained nothing that exercised
  inheritance, so both suites stayed green while the two parsers disagreed
  about the most common inheritance pattern in Django. The fixture now carries
  an abstract `Auditable` and a concrete `Chapter(Auditable)` that redeclares
  one inherited field, and both suites assert the same answer for it.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **Models built on a project-local abstract base were invisible to the whole
  extension.** The recogniser was a fixed list of base names — `models.Model`,
  `Abstract*`, `*Mixin`, `TimeStampedModel` and a few more. A base under any
  other name matched none of them, so this parsed as one model instead of two:

  ```python
  class TimeStamped(models.Model):          # found
      created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
      class Meta:
          abstract = True

  class Post(TimeStamped):                  # not found at all
      title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
  ```

  `Post` was missing from the sidebar, from the ER diagram, from hover, and
  from every DOL rule — not merely missing some fields. `class Post(TimeStamped)`
  is about as common as Django patterns get, and any project whose base is
  called `BaseModel`, `Auditable` or `SoftDelete` hit this for its entire model
  layer.

  A class already recognised as a model in a file now makes its subclasses
  models too. One forward pass covers it, because Python requires the base to
  be defined before the subclass — so a class declared *above* its base is
  still not retroactively a model, which would be inventing one. The
  non-model guard is unchanged and tested: `ModelForm`, `ModelAdmin` and their
  kind stay out however local a base is in reach. A base imported from another
  module is still matched by name only; that is a separate, larger fix.

### Added

- **Completion offers inherited fields.** `ParsedModel.fields` holds only what
  a class declares itself, so even once `Post(TimeStamped)` parsed, `created`
  was absent from its completion list while being legal in every lookup. The
  walk now climbs the declared bases, covering abstract bases — whose columns
  land on the child's own table — and concrete parents, whose columns stay on
  theirs. Either way the lookup is legal, which is the question completion is
  answering. A child redeclaring a base field wins, matching the MRO, and an
  inherited field keeps its own typed lookups: `created__year` follows a
  `DateTimeField` through the inheritance walk.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- **Completion offers reverse accessors.** Django puts an accessor on the
  *target* of every relation, named by `related_name` or, failing that, by the
  declaring model in lower case. These are as valid in a lookup as any declared
  column, and they are invisible in `ParsedModel.fields`, which holds only what
  a model declares itself. So until now the "one" side of every ForeignKey in
  a project offered nothing but its own columns:

  ```python
  Author.objects.filter(          # offered: name, pk
  Author.objects.filter(          # now also: books, edited_book
  Author.objects.filter(books__author__name=...)   # traverses back out again
  ```

  `related_name='+'` is Django's opt-out and suppresses the accessor entirely,
  so those are not offered — naming one would name something that does not
  exist.

  Suggestions now sort in four groups: declared fields, forward relations,
  reverse accessors, then lookups. A lookup never pushes a field name down the
  list, since a lookup is what you reach for *after* picking a field.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- **Completion resolves a queryset bound to a name**
  ([#83](https://github.com/FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens/issues/83)). v0.13.0
  handled the literal `Post.objects.filter(` and nothing else, which meant the
  single most common real shape — anything that builds a queryset
  conditionally — offered nothing:

  ```python
  qs = Post.objects.all()
  if request.GET.get("mine"):
      qs = qs.exclude(published=False)
  qs = qs.filter(auth        # now offers `author`
  ```

  The scan walks backwards from the cursor for the binding of that name and
  follows `qs = qs.filter(...)` hops back to the model. The nearest binding
  wins, because a rebinding makes the earlier one dead as far as the cursor is
  concerned.

  Three refusals matter as much as the resolution, and each has a test. A
  binding whose right-hand side is not recognised — `qs = build_queryset(request)`
  — **poisons** the lookup rather than falling through to an older binding of
  the same name, which would answer with a model the code no longer holds. A
  binding on the far side of a `def` or `class` is a different variable and is
  not used. And a dotted receiver like `self.qs.filter(` is not treated as the
  local `qs`, however similar the trailing name looks.

  The module stays a pure function: the preceding lines are a parameter, not a
  document read from inside it, so all twelve new cases run without a VS Code
  host. The provider passes at most 200 lines of context — the scan stops at
  the enclosing `def` anyway, so this only bounds a module-level binding with a
  very long file under it.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-08-20

### Changed

- **The Marketplace listing leads with autocomplete, and is searchable for
  it.** v0.13.0 shipped the feature #3 called the moat — the one thing no
  shipped Django extension does well — and then described the extension
  without mentioning it. The keyword list had no `autocomplete`, no
  `intellisense`, no `completion`: the exact words someone types when they
  want this. A feature nobody can search for is a feature nobody finds.

  This is v0.10.1 repeating, and it needs a release of its own for the same
  reason: store metadata takes effect only on publish, so it cannot ride along
  with the next feature without being invisible until then.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- **Field completion inside `Post.objects.filter(...)`** — the moat feature
  from [#3](https://github.com/FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens/issues/3), open
  since the project's second day. Typing inside `filter`, `exclude`, `get`,
  `annotate`, `order_by`, `values`, `only`, `defer` and their siblings offers
  the model's fields, and `author__` walks the ForeignKey to offer the *related*
  model's fields. Two edges compose: `parent__author__name`. A
  self-referential `ForeignKey('self')` resolves back to its own model.

  Lookups are typed rather than a flat list. `title__` offers `icontains` and
  `istartswith` but not `gt`; `views__` offers `gte` and `range` but not
  `icontains`; `created__` adds `year`, `month`, `hour` and `date`; a
  `BooleanField` stays at `exact` / `in` / `isnull`, because listing ordered
  lookups there is noise in the one place the list should be shortest.

  The decision is `completionsAt()` in `src/ormCompletions.ts` — a pure
  function over a line of text and the parsed index, with no `vscode` import,
  covered by 30 tests. Scope is "best effort, never wrong-looking": resolving a
  queryset's model in general needs type inference across assignments and
  managers, so what is implemented is the literal `<Model>.objects.<method>(`
  shape that covers the great majority of real calls, and everything outside it
  returns nothing rather than a guess. An empty list costs the user nothing; a
  list of fields from the wrong model costs them a debugging session. In that
  spirit the cursor being past an `=` — typing a *value* — offers nothing, and
  a paren inside a string literal does not open a completion context at all.

  Two details that are invisible until they are wrong: `_` is a trigger
  character alongside `(` and `,`, because a lookup path never leaves a word
  and VS Code would not re-query after `author__` on its own; and the replaced
  range is the whole lookup path rather than VS Code's default word range,
  which stops at the last `__` and would land `author__name` as
  `author__author__name`. Both have tests.

  New setting `djangoOrmLens.completions.enabled` (default `true`), read per
  request so toggling it needs no window reload.

## [py-1.13.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- **The MCP server runs on mcp 2.x, and 3.9 keeps mcp 1.x.** mcp 2.0.0 deleted
  `mcp.server.fastmcp`, the only name `mcp_server.main()` knew, so the extra
  installed cleanly and then told the user `requires the 'mcp' package` about a
  package sitting in site-packages. The bound was capped at `<2` to stop that;
  this lifts the cap by teaching the bootstrap both SDKs rather than by
  widening a version range and hoping.

  `_load_server_class()` prefers `MCPServer` from `mcp.server` and falls back
  to `FastMCP`. The decorator and `run()` halves are identical between the two,
  so that import is the whole difference — except for one improvement: 2.x
  takes `version=` at construction, which is exactly what
  `_advertise_our_version()` exists to fake on 1.x, so on 2.x the version now
  reaches `initialize` through supported API instead of a private attribute.

  The extra splits on an environment marker rather than dropping a Python:
  `mcp>=1.0,<2` below 3.10 and `mcp>=2.0,<3` at 3.10 and up. mcp 2.0 requires
  3.10, and this package supports 3.9 — dropping 3.9 across a CLI whose whole
  pitch is working against old, broken checkouts, to satisfy one optional
  extra, would be the tail wagging the dog. Both ceilings stay closed, so a 3.0
  that removes `MCPServer` the way 2.0 removed `FastMCP` fails a test rather
  than a user's terminal.

  Verified against a real mcp 2.0.0 install, not only against the import logic:
  all thirteen tools register through the 2.x decorator, `workspace_root`
  appears in every `inputSchema`, and `initialize` reports this package's
  version.

### Fixed

- **CI never once constructed the MCP server against a real SDK.** The `dev`
  extra does not pull `mcp`, so every test touching it hit its `FastMCP is
  None` sentinel and skipped — twelve green matrix legs, zero coverage of the
  bootstrap. That is precisely how an SDK deleting the module this server
  imports became a user-visible failure instead of a red build. One leg
  (3.12 / Django 5.2, where the marker resolves mcp 2.x) now installs the
  extra. The SDK path does not vary by Django version, so one leg buys the
  coverage and the other eleven buy only install time.

- **`_advertise_our_version()` silently did nothing on mcp 2.x.** It looked for
  `_mcp_server`, the FastMCP handle; `MCPServer` calls it `_lowlevel_server`
  and raises `AttributeError` for the old name. Measured, not assumed. The
  handle is now resolved through `_lowlevel_handle()`, which tries both and
  degrades to leaving the version alone rather than throwing if a third SDK
  names it something else again.

## [0.12.2] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- **The webview message guard has a test that runs without a browser.** The
  guard reported in [#55](https://github.com/FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens/issues/55)
  — every `postMessage` from the extension host dropped, so an open ER panel
  never updated — was fixed on the day it was measured, in `f93e5fd`, and has
  shipped since v0.10.0. What did not ship was anything to stop it happening
  again.

  It could not have: the policy lived inside `src/webview/`, which tsconfig
  excludes from `tsc` because esbuild bundles it separately, so nothing in it
  reaches `out/` and nothing in it can be `require`d by a test. A guard that
  rejected every real message was invisible to a fully green suite — the same
  shape of failure as the py-1.9 → 1.12 wave, and the reason the first paint
  kept working is that initial state is embedded in the HTML rather than sent
  over the channel, so the bug only appeared on *update*.

  The decision is now `acceptsMessage()` in `src/webviewMessages.ts`, a pure
  function importable from both the bundle and the test, covered by ten cases:
  an `index` and a `theme` push are accepted regardless of `source` — the
  regression itself — while a foreign origin, an origin that merely prefixes
  ours, a missing origin, an unknown `type`, and a non-object payload are all
  rejected without throwing.

### Fixed

- **DOL007 reported an N+1 on loops that iterate model classes.** Reported in
  [#72](https://github.com/FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens/issues/72).

  The rule treated every `for x in <expr>:` head as a loop over a queryset, so
  a sweep like `for model in auditory_models():` was in scope and
  `model.ANONYMISE_AFTER` — a plain class attribute resolved through the MRO,
  no database involved — came back as a possible N+1 suggesting
  `select_related()` / `prefetch_related()`, which have nothing to act on
  there. Loops over `range(...)`, `os.listdir(...)` and any other helper call
  were reported the same way.

  The loop head is now gated on its source. A source containing a `(` is in
  scope only when the text before that first `(` is
  `<Model>.objects.<method>` — exactly three dotted segments with `objects`
  in the middle — or a dotted chain ending in a queryset-producing method
  (`filter`, `exclude`, `annotate`, `order_by`, …). `range(...)`,
  `os.listdir(...)`, `apps.get_models()` and a helper call such as
  `auditory_models()` are skipped. The cost is a false negative: a helper
  that does return a queryset, `recent()` or `self.get_queryset()`, is
  skipped as well, because a line-oriented rule cannot follow what a callee
  returns.

  A source containing no `(` — a bare name (`for user in users:`) or a
  dotted chain (`for entry in self.pending:`) — is still in scope: it names
  no call, so it is evidence neither way, and `users = User.objects.all()`
  is the common idiom.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **Export as SVG wrote an unopenable file.** Reported by a user; PNG export
  was never affected, which is why this survived since the feature landed.

  `html-to-image` returns two different data-URL flavours. `toPng` gives
  `data:image/png;base64,…`; `toSvg` gives
  `data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,` followed by *percent-encoded* markup.
  The save path assumed base64 for anything starting with `data:`, and
  base64-decoding percent-encoded text does not fail — the decoder silently
  drops `%`, `<`, `"` and every other character outside its alphabet and
  happily returns bytes. A 48-character `<svg>` document came out as
  `dc 2b 2f 83 6d 31 9a 59 …`, so the file on disk had the right name, a
  plausible size, and no valid content anywhere in it.

  The transfer encoding is now read from the data URL header instead of
  guessed from the `data:` prefix, so base64 and percent-encoded payloads each
  take their own path. A malformed escape sequence falls back to writing the
  raw text rather than throwing away the export.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- **The extension now asks for a GitHub star — once, and only after it has
  been useful.** Measured on 2026-08-12: 62 Marketplace installs against 61
  GitHub stars. Installs overtaking stars says people find the extension in
  the Marketplace, use it, and never open the repository; the ask was absent
  entirely, so its conversion was not low, it was zero by construction.

  The prompt is deliberately not shown on install — a prompt that arrives
  before the tool has done anything gets dismissed reflexively, and that
  dismissal is permanent in the user's mind whether or not it is in ours. It
  fires on the third *user-initiated* ER diagram open. Sidebar refreshes that
  re-render an already-open panel are not counted: they are not the user
  asking for anything, and counting them would inflate the trigger into
  something closer to a timer.

  "Later" and "Don't ask again" are stored as separate states. Conflating
  them either nags someone who declined or silently drops someone who was
  merely busy. A deferral re-arms the ask exactly once, twelve opens later;
  ignored twice, it goes quiet for good. Two prompts, lifetime maximum.

  The decision is a pure function (`shouldPrompt`) with the thresholds
  injectable, so the policy is covered by six tests that need no VS Code
  host. Everything touching `vscode` is confined to one function, and it
  swallows its own errors: a broken nag must not break the diagram it is
  attached to.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- **The sidebar and the ER diagram now see django-mptt models.** The extension
  ships the TypeScript half of the parser change released as py-1.12.0: a class
  built on `MPTTModel` used to be skipped before any field was read, and
  `TreeForeignKey` / `TreeOneToOneField` / `TreeManyToManyField` were dropped
  against the field whitelist even inside a model that was detected. Both are
  fixed, and the `Tree*` fields are reported as the Django field they subclass,
  so a `TreeForeignKey('self', ...)` draws the same self-edge a plain
  `ForeignKey('self', ...)` does.

  Cut as its own release rather than folded into a later one: between
  py-1.12.0 shipping and this version, the CLI and the extension disagreed
  about what a django-mptt schema contains, which is the exact failure the
  shared golden fixture exists to prevent. See the py-1.12.0 entry below for
  the full reasoning and the Saleor measurement.

## [py-1.12.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- **django-mptt models are no longer invisible.** `MPTTModel` matched none of
  the base-class patterns the parser recognises, so a `class Category(MPTTModel)`
  was dropped before a single field was read — absent from the sidebar, the ER
  diagram, and every analyzer. Closing that alone would not have been enough:
  `TreeForeignKey`, `TreeOneToOneField` and `TreeManyToManyField` are checked
  against a literal whitelist too, so the model would have surfaced with its
  scalar fields and no edges at all — worse than hidden, because it looks
  complete. Both halves are fixed. The `Tree*` fields are thin subclasses of
  Django's own relation fields, so they are reported as the field they
  subclass: `TreeForeignKey('self', ...)` produces exactly the self-edge a
  plain `ForeignKey('self', ...)` does, honouring `on_delete` and
  `related_name`, and nothing downstream needs to learn about mptt.

  Measured on the vendored corpus: Saleor's `product.Category` — a real
  `MPTTModel` with a self-referential `parent` — now appears in the golden
  snapshot with all of its fields and its `children` edge. The snapshot diff
  is 76 added lines and no removed ones, so nothing that used to parse was
  disturbed.

  Additive and import-free by design: no `django-mptt` dependency, so the
  parser keeps working against a project whose venv is broken. Mirrored in
  `src/parser.ts` so the extension and the CLI cannot disagree about a schema.
  Closes #49.

### Fixed

- **`DOL021` documented the `USE_TZ` default wrongly, and overstated what
  `timezone.now()` returns.** The page claimed `USE_TZ=True` was "Django's
  default since 4.0". It was not: the framework default in
  `django.conf.global_settings` stayed `False` through 4.2 and became `True`
  only in 5.0. Since 4.0 the `startproject` template writes `USE_TZ = True`
  into generated settings, which is a separate thing — a project upgraded to
  4.x keeps `False` until someone sets it. Collapsing the two misled exactly
  the most common reader: an existing 4.x project with the setting untouched.
  The page also called `timezone.now()` "an aware UTC datetime" flatly, when
  it follows the setting and returns naive local time under `USE_TZ=False`.
  The same claim was duplicated in `src/rules/datetime.ts` and is corrected
  there too. Found by [@Justine0211](https://github.com/Justine0211) while
  translating the page, by declining to translate a statement they could not
  verify against the Django release notes.

### Changed

- The `parity_input.py` test fixture now carries the `from django.db import
  models` import a real `models.py` would have. No behaviour change — the
  parity test asserts model shape, never line numbers — but the fixture reads
  as genuine Django, and starts clean if that directory is ever linted.

## [py-1.11.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- **django-taggit's `TaggableManager` is a many-to-many relation now.** It
  declares itself like an ordinary field, but the relation it creates runs
  through `taggit.TaggedItem` to `taggit.Tag`. The parser saw a field type it
  did not know and dropped the edge, so every tagged model showed one relation
  fewer than it has — on the Read the Docs golden fixture the `tags` field was
  absent outright, which is why that snapshot gains an entry rather than
  changing one. Explicit `through=` overrides are honoured. Both parsers are
  updated, Python and TypeScript, so the CLI and the extension keep answering
  identically. Contributed by [@Guflly](https://github.com/Guflly) in

## [py-1.10.0] - 2026-07-31

Three defects found by running the CLI over real checkouts of django-oscar,
django-guardian, django-allauth and django-cms rather than over fixtures. Each
one was invisible to a green test suite, and two of them made the tool answer
confidently with something false.

### Fixed

- **`drift` reported a false blocking failure when two apps shared a name.**
  The third finding from the same real-world run, on django-guardian, which
  ships both `example_project/core` and `example_project_custom_group/core`.
  The parser labels an app by its directory, so the *declared* side merged the
  two; the migration side replayed each directory on its own. One project's
  migrations were therefore compared against both projects' models, and the
  report contradicted itself — `core.customgroup` came out as "declared, but
  no migration creates it" **and** "migrated but no longer declared", with
  `core.customuser` printed twice. The first of those is a blocking verdict,
  so anyone running `drift` in CI over a repo with two same-named app
  directories — every monorepo — could have a build failed by a model that was
  migrated perfectly well. Replayed state is now merged per app name, matching
  how the declared side is already keyed. On the real guardian checkout the
  blocking count goes from 1 to 0 and the duplicate row disappears, while a
  genuinely unmigrated field still blocks.

- **Abstract bases in `abstract_models.py` were never read.** The other half of
  the same django-oscar run: once its models were found, 72 of the 83 had zero
  fields between them, because every pluggable framework keeps the abstract
  base in `abstract_models.py` and leaves `models.py` holding only the
  concrete subclass. A model reported with no columns reads as a schema that
  lost them, which is a worse answer than admitting the file was not read.
  The workspace walk now takes `abstract_models.py` alongside `models.py`;
  the bases are still dropped from the results, they only become available for
  inheritance. oscar goes from 72 empty models to 8 — and those 8 are correct:
  they subclass *concrete* models, where multi-table inheritance leaves the
  columns on the parent's table.

- **Models declared inside a module-level block were invisible.** Running the
  CLI over a real django-oscar checkout — not a fixture — showed 12 models for
  the whole framework, and every one of them came from oscar's `tests/`
  directory: 21 of its 22 app `models.py` files parsed to nothing. Catalogue,
  order, offer, partner, payment, shipping, voucher, customer, address,
  analytics, reviews and wishlists were all missing. Reporting a project's
  test fixtures as its schema is worse than reporting none of it.
  The cause is the swappable-model idiom every pluggable Django framework
  uses — `if not is_model_registered(...):` and then an indented `class` —
  against class discovery anchored on `^class`. A class is now matched on its
  dedented view and accepted when everything enclosing it is a block statement
  (`if`, `try`, `with`, `for`); a `def` or `class` outwards still rejects it,
  so `Meta`, nested helpers and factory-local models stay out. django-oscar
  now yields 82 models. All six golden snapshots are byte-identical: a
  column-0 class parses exactly as before.

### Added

- **A sixth golden fixture: Read the Docs.** The vendored `projects/models.py`,
  its generated snapshot, reproducible fetch metadata and MIT attribution, next
  to Zulip, Saleor, Wagtail, django-CMS and Mezzanine — 16 models and 142
  fields more, putting the parser under 75 models and 537 fields of real-world
  Django. Verified byte-identical to upstream blob `cf1e913d` before merge:
  fixtures are parser *input* for byte-stable snapshots, so an edited copy
  would quietly rewrite what those snapshots assert. Contributed by

## [0.10.1] - 2026-07-30

Extension release, marketplace metadata only — no code change. The listing
still described the extension as a sidebar and an ER diagram, which is what it
was two waves ago: impact analysis, blast radius and schema drift had shipped
and nothing on the store page said so. Someone searching for those never found
it. The description now names them and says plainly that it is free and MIT
with no Pro tier, and seven keywords were added (`schema drift`, `impact
analysis`, `blast radius`, `code review`, `pull request`, `free`,
`open source`). Both take effect only on publish, which is why they needed a
release of their own.

## [py-1.9.0] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- **The MCP server reported the SDK's version as its own.** `FastMCP` takes no
  version and forwards none to the low-level `Server`, and the SDK then falls
  back to `importlib.metadata.version("mcp")` — so every `initialize` response
  told the client this server was `1.29.0`, the `mcp` release number. Anything
  keying an integration or a bug report off the reported version was reading
  the wrong project's. The package version is now set on the server the SDK
  actually reads, and the tests assert the value that reaches `initialize`
  rather than the attribute we write, so a future SDK rename fails the suite
  instead of silently restoring the wrong number.

- **Abstract base fields count as the child's own.** `drift` compared each
  model's migrations against only what its class body declares, so every model
  whose columns come from an abstract base looked like it had dropped them.
  On django-guardian the two permission models reported four fields each as
  "migrated but no longer declared" — advisory noise on a project with no
  drift at all. The parser now resolves abstract inheritance the way Django
  does: an abstract base's fields land on every concrete descendant, a field
  the child redeclares wins, and a *concrete* base donates nothing because
  multi-table inheritance leaves the parent's columns on the parent's table.
  The fields are exposed as `inherited_fields` / `all_fields()`, kept out of
  the tree and ER output so those keep showing what each class literally
  declares. Reported by [@sevdog](https://github.com/sevdog) in
  [#58](https://github.com/FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens/issues/58).

- **`suggest-index` stops proposing indexes that already exist.** It read
  `Meta.indexes` and nothing else, so it recommended indexes for the primary
  key, for `db_index=True` and `unique=True` fields, for foreign keys (Django
  indexes those itself), and for column groups already covered by
  `unique_together` or a `UniqueConstraint`. `filter(pk=…)` and `filter(id=…)`
  were also counted as two different fields when they are one lookup — they
  now fold onto the real primary-key column. A field left without a proposal
  for this reason appears under a new `already_indexed` key, so silence is
  distinguishable from the analyzer having missed the usage.
  Underlying all of it: the parser truncated any multi-line `class Meta` value
  to a bare `[`, which is why `constraints` and a list-per-line `indexes` were
  invisible. Both list and tuple spellings of `fields=` are read.
  Reported by [@sevdog](https://github.com/sevdog) in
  [#60](https://github.com/FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens/issues/60);
  [@RinZ27](https://github.com/RinZ27) independently diagnosed the same cause
  in [#61](https://github.com/FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens/pull/61).

## [py-1.8.1] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- **`drift` explains its own marks.** The text report tagged every entry `!!`
  or `~` and documented neither, so the only way to learn what they meant was
  to read `drift.py`. A two-line legend now precedes the entries, the same two
  lines appear in `drift --help` alongside the exit-code rule, and the legend
  is imported from the module that prints the marks rather than retyped, so
  the two cannot fall out of step. No legend on a clean run — nothing is
  marked there. JSON is unchanged; it always carried `"blocking"` outright.
  Reported by [@sevdog](https://github.com/sevdog) in
  [#57](https://github.com/FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens/issues/57).

## [py-1.8.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- **`blast_radius`, `drift` and `impact` are MCP tools now.** The four
  analyzers added in 1.7.0 shipped to the CLI only, which quietly broke the
  project's own promise of three surfaces over one parser core: an agent
  could ask what a model looked like but not what dropping a field would
  hit. All three are exposed with the same workspace resolution and the same
  structured error envelope as the existing tools, taking the tool count from
  ten to thirteen. `blast_radius` accepts an optional `severity`; `impact`
  requires a `name` and returns `MISSING_NAME` rather than an empty result
  when it is absent.

## [py-1.7.1] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **`pip install "django-orm-lens[mcp]"` produced a server that would not
  start.** The extra asked for `mcp>=1.0`, so a fresh install resolved
  **mcp 2.0.0**, which removed `mcp.server.fastmcp` — the module the server
  bootstraps from. Every new MCP install since that release printed
  *"django-orm-lens MCP requires the 'mcp' package"* and exited, while the
  package was in fact installed. Capped to `mcp>=1.0,<2`; adapting to the 2.x
  API is separate work. A regression test now pins the upper bound so it
  cannot be widened without the code changing too.
  Found because the Glama directory's build failed: it builds the repo's
  Dockerfile and speaks MCP to the container, which is a stricter check than
  anything in the test suite, all of which ran against a local mcp 1.28.1.
- **The published container defaulted to `--help` instead of the MCP server.**
  Directories that index MCP servers build the Dockerfile and then try to talk
  to the container over stdio; it printed usage and exited. Only `CMD`
  changed, so `docker run ... scan --path .` and every other documented CLI
  invocation behave exactly as before.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-29

Extension release. Everything here has been on `main` for some time; the
webview and security work shipped to the CLI in earlier `py-*` releases while
the extension binary stayed at 0.9.0, so this is the build that actually puts
it in front of editor users.

### Fixed

- **Impact Analysis grouped whole projects under the wrong layer.** Layer
  detection matched patterns like `/tests/` and `/views.py` anywhere in a
  file's **absolute** path, so a project checked out under any directory
  called `tests` — or a monorepo with `services/tests/` above it — had every
  one of its files reported as that layer: `views.py` as a test, `admin.py`
  as a test. Classification now runs on the path relative to the workspace
  root, via `layerOf` fed from `workspace.asRelativePath`, so only the
  project's own layout counts. The CLI half of this fix shipped in py-1.7.0;
  this is the editor half.
- **Webview messages are validated by origin rather than by source.**
- **Security review follow-ups** — the findings from the full-repo review and
  the open CodeQL alerts, carried over from `6262963` and `984aa22`.

### Added

- **Conflicting leaf migrations are detected** — two migrations claiming the
  same parent, which Django only complains about at `migrate` time.

## [py-1.7.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- **`blast-radius`** — the review-time question the tool could not answer
  before: *what does this schema change actually hit?* Every destructive
  migration operation (`RemoveField`, `DeleteModel`, `RenameField`,
  `RenameModel`, `AlterField`) becomes a target carrying its migration risks,
  every place in the codebase that still references it, and — for whole-model
  operations — the cascade fallout. The three analyzers behind it already
  shipped separately; nobody joined them by hand, so the tool does it now.
  `--format markdown` emits a ready-to-post PR comment, `--format github`
  emits annotations naming the reference count in the title, and `--only`
  narrows the scan to a PR's changed migration files. Exit code `1` on
  remaining critical risks, matching `migration-risk`. Available through the
  GitHub Action as `command: blast-radius`.
- **`drift`** — `makemigrations --check` without booting Django. Each app's
  migrations are replayed in numeric order into the field set they imply, and
  compared against what `models.py` declares. Django's own check needs a
  working settings module, an importable app registry and every dependency
  installed, so it is unavailable on a cold clone or a broken venv — exactly
  when acting on the answer is cheapest. Only the dangerous direction fails
  the build: a field declared but never migrated (the column will not exist,
  and the first query touching it errors), or a model with no `CreateModel`
  anywhere. Columns present in the migrations but absent from `models.py` are
  reported without blocking, because static analysis cannot see fields
  injected by mixins or metaclass-resolved abstract bases, and failing on
  those would teach people to pass `--exit-zero` permanently.
- **`nplusone` now resolves across functions** — the detector used to give up
  whenever a loop's source was a call rather than an inline chain or a local
  variable, which is how a large share of real Django code is written: the
  queryset is built in a helper or in `get_queryset()`, and the loop lives
  elsewhere. `for post in recent():` is now analysed. Resolution is one hop
  within the module and covers `helper()`, `self.get_queryset()`,
  `cls.build()`, a helper returning a local binding, a return from inside an
  `if`, and a helper defined *after* its caller. Fixes count from either side
  of the call — `select_related` inside the helper and
  `recent().select_related(...)` applied by the caller are both silent, since
  the two chains are spliced before the check. A nested `def`'s return is
  never attributed to the function enclosing it, and a call to a name the
  module does not define is left alone rather than assigned an invented
  model.
- **`blast-radius --stats` and `stats-sql`** — optional production table
  statistics, with **no database connection**. `stats-sql` prints a read-only
  query (`pg_stat_user_tables` + `pg_total_relation_size`, no locks, no user
  data); you run it against a replica and pass the JSON to `--stats`. The
  report then says `blog_post: ~41 000 000 rows, 12.0 GB, 4 index(es)`
  instead of leaning on the "anything after `0001_` is populated" heuristic.
  A credential never enters CI config and there is nothing to leak; the file
  can be committed and reviewed like any other input. Numbers are always
  labelled as estimates — `n_live_tup` drifts between `ANALYZE` runs — and a
  table absent from the file is reported as **unknown**, never as zero, so a
  model production has never seen cannot read as "safe to drop".
  `Meta.db_table` is honoured when resolving a model to its table.
- **`blast-radius` as a real PR bot** — the Action gained `comment: true`,
  which posts the markdown report and then *updates that same comment* on
  every later push, so a twenty-push PR carries one report rather than
  twenty. Matching is by the `<!-- django-orm-lens: blast-radius -->` marker
  the renderer emits as its first line. `only-changed: true` narrows the
  report to migrations the PR actually touches and exits early when it
  touches none; the file list comes from the API rather than `git diff`,
  because `actions/checkout` defaults to `fetch-depth: 1` and the base commit
  is simply not in the local history. The comment is posted *before* the job
  fails, so a blocked PR still carries the explanation — the exit code is
  preserved either way. On `push` events both flags skip with a notice
  instead of failing, so one workflow covers both triggers.
- **`impact <name>`** — "what still references this field or model?", grouped
  by Django layer with a `certain` / `likely` / `possibly` confidence tag.
  The analysis existed only inside the VS Code extension; it now ships in the
  CLI too, which is what makes `blast-radius` possible in CI.
- **`er --format dot`** — Graphviz DOT export alongside Mermaid, DBML, D2 and
  PlantUML, exposed through both the CLI and the MCP `er_diagram` tool. Apps
  become `subgraph cluster_*` blocks and model bodies are HTML tables rather
  than record labels, so field names containing `|` or `<` cannot break the
  render. Useful in particular for projects migrating from
  `django-extensions graph_models`, which emits the same format.

  first outside contribution. Closes
  [#48](https://github.com/FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens/issues/48).
- **Vietnamese rule reference** — `docs/i18n/rules/vi/` covers the queryset
  family `DOL001`–`DOL007`, the first translation of the rule pages into any
  language. Code samples, rule codes and suppression syntax stay identical to
  the English source so they remain copy-pasteable and greppable. Contributed

  [#54](https://github.com/FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens/pull/54), against
  [#52](https://github.com/FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens/issues/52).

### Fixed

- **Layer detection no longer reads the checkout path** — impact analysis
  classifies a file by matching patterns like `/tests/` and `/views.py`
  against its path, and it was matching the *absolute* path. A project
  checked out under any directory called `tests` (or `api`, `forms`, …) had
  every one of its files classified into that layer — `views.py` reported as
  `tests`, and so on, in the Impact Analysis panel. Classification now runs
  on the path relative to the workspace root, so only the project's own
  layout counts. Fixed in both implementations: the CLI analyzer and the
  VS Code extension (`layerOf`, which the extension feeds from
  `workspace.asRelativePath`). Caught by the first end-to-end run of
  `blast-radius`, whose fixture happens to live under `cli/tests/`.
- **DOL005 and DOL006 documentation** — DOL005 claimed the `Q(...)` rewrite
  buys "one pass for the query planner"; Django already compiles the chained
  form into a single query, so the rule is a legibility hint and now says so.
  DOL006 claimed `list(qs)` builds "a second in-memory copy of every row"; it
  does not duplicate the model instances, and dropping the wrapper does not
  give you streaming — that still needs an explicit `.iterator()`. Both had
  been wrong since the rules shipped, and surfaced during review of #54.

## [py-1.6.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- **`conflicting_migration_leaves`** (migration-risk rule 16) — flags an app
  whose migration graph has more than one leaf, the state Django rejects with
  "Conflicting migrations detected; multiple leaf nodes in the migration
  graph". Two branches each adding a migration on the same parent produce it.
  Detected from the `dependencies` tuples alone, so it fires on a cold clone
  and in CI rather than waiting for someone to run `migrate` against a real
  database. Reported once per conflicting leaf, and inherits the existing
  SARIF and GitHub-annotation output. The Django app *label* is recovered from
  the dependencies, since `AppConfig.label` may differ from the package
  directory; the rule stays silent when that is ambiguous.
- **Sidebar visibility toggles** — checkboxes on apps and models. Unchecking
  hides the item from the ER diagram, cascading from an app to its models, and
  relations pointing at a hidden model are dropped so no edge dangles. The
  state persists per workspace, and stores what is *hidden* rather than what is
  visible, so a model added later shows up instead of silently disappearing.

### Fixed

- The ER webview reloaded a cached `graph.js`: the script URI never changed
  between builds, so a rebuilt bundle could not reach the panel. Cache-busted
  on the bundle's mtime.

## [py-1.5.1] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- `python -m django_orm_lens` now works. The package shipped without a
  `__main__.py`, so the module invocation failed with "No module named
  django_orm_lens.__main__" even though the `django-orm-lens` console script
  was fine. `python -m` is the invocation that does not depend on the scripts
  directory being on PATH, which is what CI images, tox environments and fresh
  venvs rely on. Two regression tests cover it.

## [py-1.5.0] - 2026-07-28

The "one core, three surfaces" wave: the CLI gains CI-native output formats,
four analyzers that were previously MCP-only, community-standard diagram
exports, and a documentation page for every rule.

### Added

- **CI output formats** — `nplusone` and `migration-risk` accept
  `--format sarif` (SARIF 2.1.0 for GitHub Code Scanning via
  `upload-sarif`) and `--format github` (workflow-command PR annotations,
  zero extra permissions). New module `ci_formats.py`; 20 tests.
- **Four new CLI subcommands** exposing analyzers that existed only behind
  MCP: `suggest-indexes <model>` (Meta.indexes proposals from observed
  QuerySet usage), `signals` (sender→signal→handler graph),
  `migration-deps <app>` (per-app migration DAG — text/json/mermaid),
  `cascade <model>` (delete blast-radius grouped by on_delete). Cascade
  logic moved into shared `models.cascade_preview` so the CLI and the MCP
  server can never drift.
- **ER diagram export formats** — `er --format dbml | d2 | plantuml`
  alongside the Mermaid default; the MCP `er_diagram` tool takes the same
  choice via a new optional `diagram_format` argument. DBML maps
  `on_delete` onto ref settings and apps onto schemas; D2 uses `sql_table`
  shapes with apps as containers; PlantUML uses crow's-foot entities.
  Explicit `primary_key=True` is respected; Django's implicit `id` is
  synthesized otherwise. 11 tests.
- **Three new migration-risk rules** (15 total): `runpython_no_reverse`
  (data migration without reverse_code), `alter_unique_together_lock`
  (unique index build/validation on a populated table — recognises all
  four clearing forms including Django's serialized `set()`), and
  `alter_index_together_deprecated` (operation removed in Django 5.1).
- **pre-commit hooks** — `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` with
  `django-orm-lens-nplusone` and `django-orm-lens-migration-risk`, plus a
  root pyproject shim so pre-commit can install the repo directly.
- **GitHub Action** — composite `action.yml`
  (`uses: FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens@<ref>`) wrapping the CLI with
  annotation/SARIF-friendly defaults.
- **docs/rules/** — 19 documentation pages: one per DOL rule (16), the
  migration-risk catalogue, the N+1 analyzer, and an index. Fixes the 16
  dead `docsUrl` links the Problems panel has been shipping.
- **Golden snapshot suite** — full parser-output snapshots for the five
  vendored real-world projects (59 models, 13,478 LOC); parser regressions
  now fail with a diff instead of passing silently.
  `UPDATE_GOLDEN_SNAPSHOTS=1` regenerates.
- **Manifest-sync test** — pyproject / server.json / smithery.yaml versions
  and the MCP tool count vs docstring can no longer drift.
- **CI lint job** — ruff + mypy on every push/PR, both starting green
  (433 ruff findings fixed, 9 mypy errors fixed across 5 files).

### Fixed

- `AlterUniqueTogether` clearing form `unique_together=set()` — the form
  `makemigrations` actually writes — no longer raises a false
  `alter_unique_together_lock`.
- MCP tool-count drift: 9 → **10 tools** everywhere (module docstring,
  section comment, `smithery.yaml` 1.2.7 → 1.4.0 with "10 read-only
  tools", `cli/README.md`).
- README accuracy: MCP table lists all 10 tools (was 5), migration-risk
  rule count corrected ("7 classes" → 15 rules), stale v0.8 labels
  removed.
- DBML export notes are workspace-relative — no absolute machine paths in
  shareable diagrams.

### Changed

- README repositioned as "The schema intelligence layer for Django":
  10-second `uvx` quickstart, a Gate-your-CI section, a measured
  performance section (59 real-world models / 13,478 LOC parsed in ~21 ms
  best-of-3 locally), honest "when you want something else" boundaries,
  and the rule catalogue moved to `docs/rules/`.
- `migration-risk` severity filtering computes its threshold only for
  explicit severities instead of relying on a `.get(..., 99)` fallback
  for `--severity all`.

### Removed

- `media/vendor/mermaid.min.js` (3.34 MB) — dead weight since the webview
  moved to React Flow; the VSIX shrinks accordingly.

## [py-1.4.0] - 2026-07-25

Adds the tenth MCP tool: **`nplusone_scan`** — a static scan for Django ORM
N+1 anti-patterns across the workspace. Wraps the existing
`query_analyzer.scan_for_nplusone` (which had 100% CLI-level test coverage
via `test_nplusone_detector.py`) as an MCP handler so AI coding agents can
ask "are there N+1 problems in this project?" and get actionable answers
with `path:line`, the queryset variable, which related fields were
accessed, and a suggested `select_related` / `prefetch_related` fix.

### Added

- **`nplusone_scan` MCP tool** — walks every `.py` file, finds
  `for x in <queryset>:` loops, and flags attribute-chain accesses against
  the loop target that touch a related object (FK / O2O / M2M / reverse FK)
  without a matching `select_related` / `prefetch_related` clause on the
  source queryset. Uses the parsed `WorkspaceIndex` to classify relations;
  falls back to a schema-less heuristic when a model is unknown.
- **Structured findings** — returns `[{file, line, loop_var, queryset_var,
  accessed, suggested_fix, confidence}]` where `confidence` is `"high"` or
  `"medium"`. Same `WorkspaceError` envelope pattern as the other 9 tools
  on workspace-resolution failure.
- **Tests** — 2 new tests in `test_mcp_server.py` (envelope on invalid
  workspace + happy-path detection against a textbook `for book in
  Book.objects.all(): print(book.author.name)` pattern). Full Python suite:
  **238 passed** (was 236), zero regressions. Existing 40+ unit tests in
  `test_nplusone_detector.py` continue to pin scanner behaviour.

### Changed

- **`server.json` description** — bumped tool count from 9 to 10 with the
  N+1 scanner mention, so MCP Registry + Smithery listings advertise the
  new capability accurately.

## [py-1.3.0] - 2026-07-25

Professional-grade fix for the workspace-resolution silent-drop bug. Before
1.3.0 every MCP tool function was registered without a ``workspace_root``
parameter in its Python signature — FastMCP therefore treated any
``workspace_root`` kwarg passed by an AI agent as an unknown argument and
silently discarded it, then fell back to ``$DJANGO_ORM_LENS_ROOT`` or
``os.getcwd()``. Cursor, Claude Desktop and Aider intuitively call
``list_apps(workspace_root="...")``; the argument vanished, the tool returned
``[]``, and the agent concluded the server was broken. Root cause verified
against microsoft/AL#8273, openai/codex#9989, aws-toolkit-jetbrains#6173,
kirodotdev/Kiro#5662 and modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk#1097 — every one is
the same class of silent-workspace-drop symptom.

### Added

- **``workspace_root`` argument on all 9 MCP tools.** Declared in every
  handler signature so FastMCP includes it in the ``inputSchema`` served to
  ``tools/list`` — agents now see it as a first-class parameter and its
  value reaches the resolution helper unchanged.
- **New ``django_orm_lens.workspace`` module.** Single home for resolution,
  path hardening, and caching. Priority chain: explicit argument →
  ``$DJANGO_ORM_LENS_ROOT`` → current working directory. A failure at any
  chosen source is surfaced immediately instead of falling through — that
  silent fall-through is exactly what produced the pre-1.3.0 bug.
- **Path hardening.** ``os.path.expanduser`` + ``expandvars`` +
  ``Path.resolve()`` collapses ``..`` traversal and follows symlinks before
  any validation. Windows reserved device names (``CON``, ``PRN``, ``AUX``,
  ``NUL``, ``COMn``, ``LPTn``) are rejected on every OS because paths flow
  between machines. Django-marker requirement (``manage.py`` /
  ``manage.pyw`` / ``django`` in ``pyproject.toml`` / any ``models.py`` in
  the tree) rejects agent typos before they scan the wrong directory.
- **Optional allowlist.** ``DJANGO_ORM_LENS_ALLOWED_ROOTS`` (``;``-separated
  on Windows, ``:``-separated elsewhere) restricts which prefixes the agent
  may resolve to. Empty / unset preserves the historical unrestricted
  behaviour.
- **Structured error envelope.** Every failure now returns
  ``{"error": "WORKSPACE_...", "message": "...", "hint": "...", "path": "..."}``
  as the tool result — agents get an actionable message instead of ``[]``.
  Stable error codes: ``WORKSPACE_EMPTY``, ``WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND``,
  ``WORKSPACE_NOT_A_DIRECTORY``, ``WORKSPACE_NOT_DJANGO``,
  ``WORKSPACE_NOT_ALLOWED``, ``WORKSPACE_WINDOWS_RESERVED``,
  ``WORKSPACE_RESOLVE_FAILED``.
- **Compound cache key.** Index cache is now keyed by
  ``(resolved_absolute_path, manage.py mtime)`` — touching ``manage.py``
  invalidates on the next call without waiting for the 30 s TTL. Cache is
  LRU-capped at 8 workspaces so multi-project agents (Cursor with several
  folders open) can't unbounded-grow memory.
- **Tests:** ``test_mcp_workspace.py`` (23 unit tests: hardening, priority
  chain, allowlist, cache) + ``test_mcp_server.py`` (22 integration tests +
  18 subtests: registry contract, error envelope on every tool, happy path
  equivalence). Full Python suite: **236 passed** (up from 191), zero
  regressions. TS suite: 104/104 green (unchanged).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-24

Schema-diff gets a first-class **partial UniqueConstraint** tracker. Inspired
by django-extensions [#1813](https://github.com/django-extensions/django-extensions/issues/1813)
(BoPeng, 2023) — `sqldiff` drops the `condition=` predicate from
`UniqueConstraint` output, so migration reviewers never see what actually
changed. Django ORM Lens now surfaces these as typed events so PR diffs stop
lying.

### Added

- **`PartialUniqueConstraint` schema-diff event with four ops:**
  - `add` — new conditioned `UniqueConstraint` appeared in the new snapshot
  - `drop` — constraint existed only in the old snapshot
  - `change` — same name, condition (or field list) mutated; `fromCondition`
    carries the pre-change predicate so the review comment can show
    `Q(is_primary=True) → Q(is_primary=True, deleted=False)`
  - `rename` — same fields + same condition, only the name changed; renamed
    constraints no longer show up as a lossy `add + drop` pair
- **Anonymous-safe.** Multiple unnamed constraints on the same model no longer
  collapse into a single event — internal keying falls back to `#anon-<index>`.
- **Markdown rendering** grew four dedicated bullet variants (`**added** …`,
  `**dropped** …`, `**changed** …`, `**renamed** …`) so the PR description
  reads like a review comment, not a raw diff.
- **Tests:** 4 new snapshot tests for each op variant (add / drop / change /
  rename). Schema-diff suite: 17/17 green; full TS suite: 104/104 green.

### Referenced upstream

- <https://github.com/django-extensions/django-extensions/issues/1813> —
  root-cause description + reproducer + workaround acknowledged in

## [0.7.8] - 2026-07-21

Marketplace SEO polish — no runtime changes, no behaviour changes. VS Code extension only (CLI/MCP unchanged, still on py-1.2.7).

### Changed

- **VS Code Marketplace metadata refreshed** for better discoverability.
  - `description` rewritten to lead with the value ("See your entire Django schema in your editor") instead of the feature list.
  - `categories` expanded from `[Visualization, Other]` → `[Visualization, Programming Languages, AI, Other]` to surface in more Marketplace filters.
  - `keywords` expanded from 7 → 29 with real search terms users type: `erd`, `entity relationship`, `schema visualizer`, `model explorer`, `foreign key`, `n+1`, `query optimization`, `mcp`, `ai agent`, `cursor`, `vscodium`, `postgresql`, `django-rest-framework`, and more.
  - Added `galleryBanner` (`#0c4b33` Django-green) — the extension page now has a themed header instead of default grey.
  - Added `qna: "marketplace"` (enable built-in Q&A) and `sponsor.url` (GitHub Sponsors link surfaced in the sidebar).
- **CI:** GHCR `Wait for PyPI` step widened 5 min → 15 min. The `py-v1.2.7` publish raced the PyPI CDN and the container step failed at the pip install; wider window makes future releases robust to slow PyPI propagation.

## [0.7.7] + [py-1.2.7] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- **UTF-8 BOM (`U+FEFF`) at the start of a models.py file no longer eats the whole class.** Windows editors — Notepad, older Sublime, VS Code with certain encoding settings — save files with a byte-order mark. Without this fix the first line becomes `"﻿class Foo..."` and `CLASS_RE` fails to match, so every model in the file silently disappears. Both parsers now strip the leading BOM in the content-read step.

### Added

- **`test_bom_prefix.py`** — 2 Python regression tests (BOM-prefixed file parses; no-BOM backward-compat).

## [0.7.6] + [py-1.2.6] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- **Tab-indented model bodies now parse.** Editors that default to tabs (or projects that use PEP-8 exceptions with tabs) had every field silently dropped. `FIELD_RE` uses `\s{indent}` as its column prefix and `_detect_class_indent` correctly returns width 4 for tabs, but a single `\t` character is only one `\s` match, not four. Fixed by pre-expanding tabs to 4 spaces in the line buffer before regex matching. Applies to both parsers. Line numbers preserved (per-line expansion only).

### Added

- **`test_tab_indented_models.py`** — 3 Python regression tests (pure-tab body, mixed tab+space, and space-indent backward-compat).

## [0.7.5] + [py-1.2.5] - 2026-07-21

Two more field-detection gaps closed via targeted fuzz of realistic Django user code.

### Fixed

- **Aliased `models` module.** `from django.db import models as m` followed by `class X(m.Model): x = m.CharField(...)` used to lose every field because `FIELD_RE` hardcoded the `models\.` prefix and `BARE_FIELD_RE` had no prefix allowance. Both parsers now accept any single-identifier prefix on the RHS in `BARE_FIELD_RE`.
- **Third-party field packages.** Fields declared via a namespaced third-party import (`x = jsonfield.JSONField(...)`, `x = timezonefield.TimeZoneField(...)`, `x = arrayfield.ArrayField(...)`) fell through the same gap. Same fix covers both cases in one edit — the type name is still restricted to Django's known field whitelist, so random non-Django calls like `foo.CharField(...)` in an unrelated module don't leak in.

### Added

- **`test_aliased_module_and_third_party_fields.py`** — 4 Python regression tests (aliased-only, mixed aliased+plain+bare interleaved, jsonfield-style third-party, and backward-compat bare imports).

## [0.7.4] + [py-1.2.4] - 2026-07-21

Follow-up to the modern-Python audit that produced 0.7.3 — another shape of typed code that used to silently vanish, surfaced by a targeted fuzz of the class-header regex.

### Fixed

- **PEP-695 generic class headers (Python 3.12+) now parse.** The class-header regex was:

  ```
  ^class\s+([A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*)\s*\(([^)]*)\)\s*:
  ```

  which had no allowance for a `[T]` group between the class name and the opening `(`. Any model declared as `class Container[T](models.Model):` failed to match — the parser walked past the whole class, no models reported, empty sidebar / ER diagram / n+1 output. Applies to all four common PEP-695 shapes: single-param `[T]`, multi-param `[K, V]`, bounded `[T: str]`, and variadic + paramspec `[*Ts, **P]`.

  Fixed by inserting an optional `(?:\s*\[[^\]]*\])?` group in both `CLASS_RE` and `CLASS_START_RE`, in both parsers (Python + TypeScript). Non-generic classes match identically as before.

### Added

- **`test_pep695_generic_classes.py`** — 5 Python regression tests covering the four PEP-695 shapes plus a backward-compat guard for plain class headers.

## [0.7.3] + [py-1.2.3] - 2026-07-20

Bugfix release for [#25](https://github.com/FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens/issues/25) — thanks to [@jsabater](https://github.com/jsabater) for the reproducible report against a Django Ninja 1.6 codebase.

### Fixed

- **Fields with PEP-526 type annotations (typed Django / Django Ninja style) no longer disappear from the parser output.** When code uses the modern typed pattern:

  ```python
  jti: CharField[str] = models.CharField(max_length=32, unique=True)
  ```

  the field regex expected `name = models.X(` and had no allowance for a `: <type>` group between the name and the `=`. Result: fields silently vanished from the sidebar tree, the ER diagram entity, and every downstream tool (n+1 detector, MCP `describe_model`, `find_relations`). Adding fields one-by-one made the whole model progressively empty — the exact reproduction jsabater observed.

  Fixed in both parsers (`parser.py::_build_body_regexes`, `src/parser.ts::buildBodyRegexes`) by adding an optional `(?:\s*:[^=]+)?` group after the field name and before `=`. `[^=]+` is safe because `=` never appears inside a Python type expression (subscripts, unions, dotted refs, and generics all use other punctuation). Applied consistently to `FIELD_RE`, `BARE_FIELD_RE`, and `META_ITEM_RE`.

### Added

- **`test_pep526_type_hints.py`** — 6 Python regression tests covering the exact snippet from the bug report, the bare-import form (`IntegerField` without `models.` prefix), simple non-generic annotations (`label: str = ...`), untyped backward-compat, and a Meta block with an annotated attribute (`ordering: list[str] = ["title"]`).
- **`test/pep526.test.js`** — matching TS regression so the VS Code extension stays behaviour-compatible with the CLI.

## [py-1.2.2] - 2026-07-20

CLI welcome UX — bidirectional discoverability between PyPI and the editor extensions. Data motivation: PyPI is doing ~1,663 installs/week while the VS Code Marketplace sits at ~10 installs total. Users who install the CLI don't know the extension exists (and vice-versa in the extension welcome view). This closes the gap.

### Changed

- **`django-orm-lens` welcome (no-arg run)** now prints a "prefer a visual sidebar + ER diagram in your editor?" block after the docs link, with copy-paste install commands for both marketplace paths:
  - `code --install-extension frowningdev.django-orm-lens` — VS Code / Cursor / Windsurf
  - `codium --install-extension frowningdev.django-orm-lens` — VSCodium / code-server / Gitpod / any OSS Code fork (via Open VSX)

  Rest of the welcome (commands table + star CTA) is unchanged.

## [py-1.2.1] - 2026-07-20

Patch release — two crash bugs in the CLI wrapper that unit tests missed because they exercised the underlying helpers directly instead of going through argparse dispatch. Both surfaced during an end-to-end smoke run against a real Django codebase.

### Fixed

- **`django-orm-lens nplusone` crashed with `NameError`** — `_cmd_nplusone` called `_build_schema_from_index` and `scan_for_nplusone` without importing either at module scope. `scan_for_nplusone` now imported at the top of `cli.py`; the intermediate schema flattening is dropped (the underlying function already accepts a `WorkspaceIndex` and normalises internally via `_normalise_schema`).
- **`django-orm-lens migration-risk` (text format) crashed with `AttributeError: 'MigrationRisk' object has no attribute 'filePath'`** — the print statement used camelCase attrs (`filePath` / `lineNumber`) but the dataclass fields are snake_case (`file_path` / `line_number`). The camelCase form only exists inside `to_dict()` (JSON path); text output now reads the snake_case fields directly.
- **`analyze_migration_risks` was not imported at module scope** — same pattern as the nplusone bug, fixed at the same time to prevent a latent `NameError` on the next code path change.

### Added

- **`test_cli_subcommands_smoke.py`** — 8 tests that dispatch every subcommand (`scan`, `list`, `er`, `describe`, `hover`, `nplusone`, `migration-risk` text + JSON) through `main([...])` against fixture data. Any `NameError` / `ImportError` / `AttributeError` in a subcommand body now surfaces as a test failure rather than a crash the next user sees. This closes the coverage gap that let both v0.7.0 bugs ship.

## [0.7.0] + [py-1.2.0] - 2026-07-20

Correctness release focused on `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` resolution across every layer (parser / signals / query analyzer / ER diagram / MCP server / VS Code webview) and kwarg-order-independent field parsing. 10 bugs closed + 4 DRY/perf refactors + 36 new regression tests. All 157 Python tests + 3 TypeScript tests green.

### Fixed

- **`ForeignKey(on_delete=CASCADE, to='User')` now resolves correctly regardless of kwarg order.** Both the Python (`_extract_related` in `parser.py`) and TypeScript (`extractRelated` in `src/parser.ts`) parsers previously used a positional-first regex that either returned `undefined` or misread `on_delete` as the target when `to=` wasn't the first kwarg. Python side now uses `ast.parse` on the wrapped arg block; TypeScript side prefers `\bto=` anywhere and falls back to positional-first with a negative lookahead against kwargs. Similar order-independence applied to `_extract_on_delete` / `_extract_related_name` / `_extract_through_model`.
- **`settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` resolves to the workspace User model in every consumer, not just the MCP layer.** Previously, `.split('.')[-1]` produced `"AUTH_USER_MODEL"` — a name no workspace model carries — dropping User-model edges from: reverse-relation schema used by the n+1 detector (`query_analyzer._build_schema_from_index` + `_build_schema_from_index_dict`), signal receiver resolution (`signals_parser._resolve_sender`), Mermaid ER diagram (`cli._build_mermaid`), VS Code Mermaid webview (`src/graphWebview.ts`), VS Code inbound-relation panel (`src/extension.ts`), and the React ER webview (`src/webview/graph.tsx`). All six paths now delegate to shared `resolve_related_tail` (Python) / `resolveRelatedTail` (TypeScript). The webview additionally receives the pre-resolved User name via the wire payload so it doesn't need `baseClasses` shipped over.
- **`--verbose` no longer walks the workspace twice.** The scan summary previously called `_iter_python_files` a second time just to count files. `WorkspaceIndex` now carries `scanned_files` (populated by `scan_workspace`), so verbose mode reads the count instead of re-iterating — noticeable on large monorepos.
- **`formatters._render_table` no longer crashes on short rows.** A row shorter than the header triggered `IndexError` inside the width-computation genexpr. Rows are now padded with `""` to header width before rendering.

### Added

- **Shared Python helpers under `django_orm_lens` package root:** `find_user_model`, `find_user_model_from_dict`, `resolve_related_tail`, `find_model`, `iter_workspace_py_files`, `BROAD_SKIP_DIRS`. Downstream tools that build on the parser can import these without duplicating the User-model detection heuristic or the walk-skip-list.
- **Shared TypeScript helpers in `src/parser.ts`:** `findUserModel(index)`, `resolveRelatedTail(related, userName)`. Same shape as the Python side so the VS Code extension and the CLI stay in sync.
- **`WorkspaceIndex.scanned_files: int`** — number of `models.py`-style files inspected during the scan. Surfaced in `to_dict()` as `scannedFiles`. Backward-compatible (default 0, extra JSON key).
- **`WireIndex.userModelName?: string`** in `src/webview/types.ts` — resolved User model name shipped to the React webview so it can rewrite `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` edges to point at the right node.
- **36 regression tests:** `test_kwarg_order_and_auth_user.py` (35 unit tests covering kwarg-order-independent extractors, User-model discovery, tail resolution, schema-building with AUTH_USER_MODEL, `_resolve_sender` cases) + `test_signals_parser::test_receiver_settings_auth_user_sender_resolves` (E2E `signal_graph`) + `test/kwarg-order.test.js` (TS regression).

### Changed

- **`_iter_py_files` consolidated across three modules.** `signals_parser`, `query_analyzer._iter_py_files`, and `query_analyzer._iter_py_files_broad` were three near-identical copies of the same directory walk with slightly different skip-lists. All three now delegate to `parser.iter_workspace_py_files(root, extra_skip=frozenset())`.
- **`_find_model` / `_find` consolidated.** `cli._find_model` and `mcp_server._find` were near-identical `WorkspaceIndex` lookups by `"app.Model"` or bare `"Model"`. Both now delegate to `models.find_model` so lookup semantics stay in sync.
- **`mcp_server._workspace_user_model` and `_rel_matches_target`** are now thin wrappers over the shared `find_user_model` + `resolve_related_tail`. Semantics unchanged; the tuple-returning signature of `_workspace_user_model` is preserved for existing callers.

## [0.6.0] + [py-1.1.0] - 2026-07-19

Feature release — three new CLI subcommands (`nplusone`, `migration-risk`, `diff`), webview polish, and three README translations. 127 tests passing.

### Added

- **CLI `nplusone` subcommand — static N+1 detector.** Walks `.py` files and flags queryset iteration where FK / M2M attributes are accessed inside the loop without a matching `.select_related(...)` / `.prefetch_related(...)`. Schema-backed high-confidence classification when a workspace index is available, heuristic medium-confidence fallback otherwise. Reports `file:line`, loop variable, queryset variable, accessed relations, and a suggested fix. Flags: `--path`, `--format text|json`, `--confidence high|medium|all`, `--exit-zero`. Exit code 1 on findings (CI-friendly). 18 tests.
- **CLI `migration-risk` subcommand — production-safety linter for Django migrations.** Analyzes `<app>/migrations/*.py` files and flags seven classes of risky operations: `AddField(NOT NULL, no default)`, `RemoveField`/`DeleteModel` still referenced by live code, `RenameField`/`RenameModel` (breaks rolling deployments), `AddIndex` without `CONCURRENTLY`, lossy `AlterField` type changes, `RunSQL` without `reverse_sql`, and `AddField(unique=True)` without a row-unique default. Cross-references the current models schema. Per-finding severity (`critical` / `warning` / `info`) and confidence (`high` / `medium` / `low`). Flags: `--path`, `--format text|json`, `--severity critical|warning|info|all`, `--exit-zero`. 31 tests.
- **CLI `diff` subcommand — compare two schema JSON dumps.** `django-orm-lens list --format=json > before.json` on `main`, then again on a PR branch → `after.json`, then `django-orm-lens diff before.json after.json` prints added / removed models, added / removed / changed fields, and added / removed / changed relations. Text and JSON output. Exit 1 on any delta (git-diff-like), `--exit-zero` for advisory CI stages. 21 tests.
- **Webview: color-code minimap dots by app.** ER-diagram minimap now tints nodes by their owning Django app using a deterministic FNV-1a-based hue, so large schemas can be visually grouped at a glance. Focused node retains the accent color.
- **CLI `list` subcommand now supports `--format json`.** `django-orm-lens list --format json` emits a pipe-friendly JSON array `[{"app": "...", "model": "..."}, ...]`. The default `text` output remains unchanged for backward compatibility.
- **`--verbose` / `-v` flag** on every scan-backed CLI subcommand (`scan`, `describe`, `hover`, `list`, `er`). Prints a one-line summary to stderr after the scan — `scanned 12 files in 34ms, found 8 apps / 47 models` — sourced from the actual file walk, a `time.perf_counter()` measurement around the scan, and the real app/model counts on the returned index. Stdout is untouched either way. (#14)
- **CLI: friendlier hint when no `models.py` is found.** `scan`/`describe`/`hover`/`list`/`er` previously printed a silently-empty result. When zero models are found *and* no `models.py`/`models/*.py` file was walked at all, a `hint: no models.py found under <path>...` line is now printed to stderr (stdout stays clean, exit code stays `0`). New `--quiet`/`-q` flag suppresses the hint. (#12)

### Docs

- **README translations:** `README.ru.md` (Russian), `README.es.md` (Spanish), `README.zh.md` (Chinese). Language switcher added at the top of each file. Closes #9, #10, #11.
- **README: added Screenshots section** between Install and The problem, with capture instructions for six product screenshots covering VS Code (sidebar / ER diagram / hover card), CLI (`list`, `er`), and MCP (Cursor conversation). Closes #15.

## [0.5.1] + [py-1.0.17] - 2026-07-16

Bugfix release focused on parser accuracy and MCP correctness. E2E audit against a synthetic Django project with abstract mixins, custom user model, multi-file `models/` packages, real migrations, signals, and views uncovered five real bugs that would have hit the ~60 % of production Django codebases that use `TimeStampedModel`-style mixins or `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL`. All fixed here without any behavioural regressions (44 pytests pass — 13 new + 31 pre-existing).

### Fixed
- **Abstract-mixin subclasses now correctly identified as models.** `class Profile(TimeStamped)` where `TimeStamped(models.Model)` is a user-defined abstract base was previously invisible to every tool — parser only walked one inheritance level and only against a small hardcoded list of known-Model tails. `parse_models_file` is now two-pass: first collects every class definition with its bases + Meta, then resolves transitive inheritance via fixed-point iteration. Any concrete subclass of any class that transitively inherits from `models.Model` (through arbitrary user-defined abstracts) is now returned.
- **`Meta.abstract = True` is now respected.** Abstract mixins previously appeared in `list_models`, `describe_model`, ER diagrams, and the VS Code sidebar as if they were concrete tables. They are now filtered out, matching what Django itself does at migration time.
- **`settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` now resolves to the workspace User model in relation lookups.** `cascade_preview(accounts.User)` and `find_relations(accounts.User)` previously returned empty inbound arrays even when other models had `ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=CASCADE)` — the recommended Django pattern. MCP layer now detects the workspace's User model (first class inheriting `AbstractUser` / `AbstractBaseUser`, else literal `User`) and treats `AUTH_USER_MODEL` refs as pointing at it.
- **`--version` shows the real installed version.** Previously hardcoded `1.0.7` across nine releases regardless of which package version was actually installed — confusing bug reports. Now sourced from `importlib.metadata` at import time.
- **CLI subcommands error on a non-existent `--path`.** `list --path /nonexistent` previously exited `0` with empty output — silent failure. Now prints `error: --path 'X' is not a directory` to stderr and exits `2`.
- **`list_models(app='wrong_name')` returns a helpful error instead of `(no models)`.** New response: `(app 'wrong_name' not found in workspace; available apps: a, b, c)`.

### Changed
- **MCP Registry description updated:** `"5 read-only tools"` → `"9 read-only tools (models, relations, cascade, migrations, indexes, signals, ER diagram)"`. Registry entry was stuck at 1.0.7 and had never reflected the four v0.4/v0.5 additions (`describe_migration_dependency`, `suggest_indexes`, `signal_graph`, `er_diagram`).

### Added
- **13 regression tests** for the fixes above under `cli/tests/test_abstract_and_auth_user.py` — abstract-drop, two-level abstract chain, plain `User` reference, `AbstractUser` subclass detection, `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` resolution, and negative cases (no user model, wrong target). Guards against regressions in the parser's inheritance logic and the MCP resolution helpers.

## [0.5.0] + [py-1.0.16] - 2026-07-16

MCP tools for AI-agent Django expertise. Ships three flagship additions built on the zero-runtime static-analysis moat: two new MCP tools that solve the top pain points in the Django tooling ecosystem — index recommendations and signal graph visualisation — plus a golden-fixture test suite that proves the parser survives real-world Django code (63 models across Zulip, Saleor, Wagtail, django-CMS). Positioning shifts from "ER diagram + navigation" to "the static-analysis brain that Django AI agents plug into."

### Added
- `suggest_indexes(app_label, model_name)` MCP tool — static analysis of every filter/exclude/order_by/get/aggregate usage across the workspace, returns field-usage frequency and proposes `Meta.indexes` covering entries. Zero-runtime, no DB, no Django boot. Solves the top Django performance blind spot for AI coding agents.
- `signal_graph()` MCP tool — parses every `@receiver()` decorator and `Signal()` definition in the workspace, returns the sender→signal→handler DAG plus custom-signal send-sites. Surfaces the invisible connections between models that cause the majority of enterprise Django bugs.
- **Golden fixture suite** — parser now tested against real open-source Django projects: Zulip (Apache-2.0, 33 models across `zerver/models/`), Saleor (BSD-3, 19 models across product/order/discount/warehouse), Wagtail (BSD-3, 8 models from `wagtail/models/`), and django-CMS (BSD-3, 3 models from `cms/models/`). Pytest asserts every project scans without error, finds at least 1 model, and the aggregate scan of all vendored fixtures completes under 2 seconds (currently ~11 ms). Credibility: `django-orm-lens` is proven against 63 total models parsed from real-world Django deployments, not synthetic examples. Fixtures live under `cli/tests/fixtures/golden/<project>/<original-path>/models.py` with attribution + fetch date in that directory's README.md.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-16

Hotfix. Extension only.

### Fixed
- **Activity-bar icon actually ships in the VSIX now.** A stray `media/*.svg` line in `.vscodeignore` (introduced during the 0.4.0 React Flow packaging pass) silently excluded `media/activitybar.svg` from the published extension. The branded icon rendered in Extension Development Host (files read from repo path directly) but was completely absent from the Marketplace VSIX — VS Code had nothing to draw, so the sidebar slot appeared blank. Ignore pattern replaced with an explicit whitelist (`!media/**/*.png`, `!media/**/*.svg`, `!media/webview/**`).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-16

VS Code extension only. Python CLI unchanged.

### Changed
- **Branded activity-bar icon** — replaced the generic Material database cylinder (which rendered as an apparently blank slot at 24×24 in some VS Code themes) with a three-connected-tables silhouette that reads unambiguously as "ORM schema" at any size. Uses `stroke="currentColor"` so the icon inherits VS Code's activity-bar foreground colour on every theme (dark/light/high-contrast). Reload the VS Code window after updating to pick up the new icon — VS Code caches activity-bar SVGs per extension host.

## [0.4.0] + [py-1.0.15] - 2026-07-16

Major visual upgrade for the ER diagram — the VS Code webview now renders every model as an interactive React Flow node instead of a static Mermaid SVG. Drag models around to lay the diagram out the way you think about it, click a node to highlight its inbound and outbound relations, double-click to jump straight to the class in `models.py`. Edges are colour-coded by relation semantics (ForeignKey CASCADE / SET_NULL / PROTECT, OneToOne, ManyToMany with `through=` label) so the on_delete blast radius is visible at a glance. Ships with a minimap, zoom controls, and PNG / SVG export. Automatic hierarchical layout via `elkjs`. Python CLI is unchanged in behaviour — the version bump keeps the extension and CLI shipping together, and the Mermaid emitter (`build_mermaid`) remains available for the CLI `--mermaid` output.

### Added
- **Interactive ER diagram (React Flow)** — replaces Mermaid rendering in the VS Code webview. Draggable nodes with rounded corners, drop shadow, and Inter-family typography. Each node shows `app · Model` header and every field with a colour-coded badge (FK / 1:1 / M2M / plain). Edges are laid out with `elkjs` layered algorithm (`RIGHT` direction, orthogonal routing) so hierarchies read naturally instead of the force-directed mush the previous Mermaid `erDiagram` rendered as workspace size grew.
- **Click-to-focus highlighting** — clicking any model dims unrelated nodes to 35 % opacity, keeps the selected node plus every connected neighbour at full brightness, and animates its edges. Click empty canvas or the same node again to clear.
- **Double-click to jump to source** — double-clicking a node posts `jumpToModel` back to the extension, which opens the `models.py` file in the primary editor column at the model's class line. Reuses the existing message handler contract from the Mermaid webview.
- **PNG + SVG export** — new Export dropdown in the header uses `html-to-image` to serialise the diagram viewport at 2× pixel ratio (PNG) or as inline SVG. Falls back to VS Code's `showSaveDialog` for the target path.
- **MiniMap + zoom controls** — bottom-right minimap (150×100) with the current selection highlighted in the accent colour; bottom-left React Flow zoom controls (zoom in / out / fit view). Both surfaces inherit VS Code panel colours via CSS variables and use a subtle `backdrop-filter: blur(6px)` for the Linear/ChartDB aesthetic.
- **Relation-kind legend** — small footer chip explains the FK CASCADE / SET_NULL / PROTECT / 1:1 / M2M colour palette so you don't have to guess.

### Changed
- **Webview build pipeline now uses esbuild.** New `npm run build:webview` bundles `src/webview/graph.tsx` → `media/webview/graph.js` as a minified IIFE (~1.85 MB raw / ~565 KB gzipped, well under the 3 MB VSIX budget). `npm run build` runs both `build:extension` (tsc) and `build:webview` (esbuild). The webview source under `src/webview/` is excluded from the extension's `tsc` project via `tsconfig.json`.
- **Webview header rebuilt to Linear/Vercel spec** — 48 px tall, subtle 2 px gradient bottom border (`transparent → focus → transparent`), workspace name in the title, app + model count badge, refresh button, and export dropdown.
- **`diagramTheme` config values `default` / `forest` / `neutral` now collapse to the `light` React Flow palette.** The old Mermaid-specific enum values are still accepted for setting compatibility but no longer produce distinct visuals — Mermaid is the only renderer that had those. `auto` and `dark` behave as before.

### Kept
- **Mermaid vendored file (`media/vendor/mermaid.min.js`) stays in the VSIX** in case a user needs to roll back to v0.3.8 by re-enabling the old renderer.
- **CLI `build_mermaid` emitter is unchanged.** The Python CLI still exposes `--mermaid` for terminal / CI consumers, so agents and pipelines that scrape the Mermaid output are unaffected.

## [0.3.8] + [py-1.0.14] - 2026-07-16

Second hotfix on the two 0.3.6 regressions that 0.3.7's partial fix did not fully resolve for users running a single-app workspace ("hello/" opened at the app root). Icon rendered blank on some installs even after the theme-aware SVG rewrite; the workspace scan still came up empty on cold-start when `vscode.workspace.findFiles` returned no results before the file index was warm. This release simplifies the icon glyph and adds a direct filesystem walker fallback so the scan never depends on the file index being ready.

### Fixed
- **Activity-bar icon is now a single centred database glyph that fills the 24×24 canvas.** The v0.3.7 SVG was already `fill="currentColor"`, but the two-shape database + magnifier composition left large empty margins on the left and top, which on some themes (and at some HiDPI scale factors) rendered as an apparently blank slot in the activity bar. Replaced with a codicon-shaped monochrome database drawn from x=4 to x=20, y=2 to y=22 — visually dense across the whole viewbox and unambiguously visible on every theme.
- **Workspace scan now falls back to a direct filesystem walk when `findFiles` returns empty.** Root cause: `vscode.workspace.findFiles` depends on VS Code's internal file index. On `onStartupFinished` activation the index can be cold, and on some Windows single-folder-workspace setups the `**/models.py` glob silently misses depth-0 `models.py` regardless. v0.3.7 tried to work around this by adding a bare `models.py` `RelativePattern` and a 1.5s startup-retry backstop; both still failed for users who open the Django app folder itself. `scanWorkspace` now runs `findFiles` first as the fast path, and if it returns zero URIs walks each workspace folder with `fs.readdirSync` directly, honouring the same exclude-glob defaults (`**/migrations/**`, `**/venv/**`, ...). Fallback runs once per empty scan — no cost when the file index is warm.

### Tests
- Added `cli/tests/test_scan_root.py` — three regression tests covering "app-as-workspace-root" (models.py at depth 0), "project-as-workspace-root" (app one level down), and the `**/migrations/**` exclude at root depth. Locks in that the shared parser behaviour never regresses on the single-app layout.

## [0.3.7] + [py-1.0.13] - 2026-07-16

Hotfix release — closes the two regressions reported against 0.3.6: the activity-bar icon rendered blank (stroke-based SVG that VS Code's activity-bar CSS couldn't theme reliably), and single-app workspaces opened at the app root ("hello/" containing `models.py` directly) came up empty because the include-glob and initial-scan timing both failed the root-file case. TypeScript extension fixes only; Python CLI + MCP server are re-published at the same version for combined-release parity.

### Fixed
- **Activity-bar icon is now visible on every theme.** The previous SVG was a stroke-based line drawing with `fill="none"` on both the root and every shape. VS Code's activity-bar renderer applies its own theme foreground via `fill: currentColor`, which the inline `fill="none"` overrode — the icon rendered as a blank slot on most themes ("I see the panel open but the sidebar icon is gone" — real user report). Icon is now a fill-based database + magnifier drawn with `fill="currentColor"`, matching the codicon convention for activity-bar entries.
- **Workspace with `models.py` at the root now scans on activation.** Two root causes: (1) `vscode.workspace.findFiles('**/models.py', ...)` was expected to match root-level files, but on some setups (notably single-folder workspaces on Windows) the leading `**/` requires at least one path segment and silently skipped `<root>/models.py`. Now uses a `vscode.RelativePattern` per workspace folder with an explicit `models.py` include alongside `**/models.py` and `**/models/*.py`, de-duplicated on `fsPath`. (2) With `onStartupFinished` activation (added in 0.3.6) the initial `refresh()` can race the workspace file index and return zero results before it's warm. Now also re-scans on `TreeView.onDidChangeVisibility` (user clicks the sidebar), on `workspace.onDidChangeWorkspaceFolders`, and once as a 1.5s startup backstop if the first scan came back empty against a non-empty workspace. Manual `Refresh scan` from the welcome view is unaffected and continues to work.

## [0.3.6] + [py-1.0.12] - 2026-07-16

Combined release — migration-dependency debugger for AI agents, always-visible activity-bar icon with empty-state welcome, and a subtle star-ask on MCP startup. Ships the three feature commits accumulated since 0.3.5: the migration DAG tool closes a gap no other Django MCP server addresses (agents can now trace conflict chains without booting Django), while the UX and star-ask improvements close the discoverability/conversion loop between install and star.

### Added
- `describe_migration_dependency` MCP tool — return per-app migration DAG (dependencies, roots, leaves, cross-app deps) from static AST parse, no Django boot. Standout differentiator: no other Django MCP server or graph tool (django-schema-graph, django-extensions graph_models, gts360/django-mcp-server, kitespark/django-mcp, admin-mcp-api) offers migration-conflict introspection without a running Django process.

### Changed
- **MCP server prints a one-line star-ask on startup** (stderr). Mirrors the CLI welcome convention from py-1.0.9. Zero effect on the JSON-RPC protocol (stderr is out-of-band); surfaces in Cursor, Aider, mcp-inspector, and any client that shows server logs.

### Fixed
- **Activity-bar icon now appears on any workspace, not only Django ones.** Previously the extension activated exclusively on `workspaceContains:**/manage.py` or `workspaceContains:**/models.py`, so a user who installed the extension without a Django project open saw no icon and no way to discover the tool ("I installed it and see nothing" — real user report). Added `onStartupFinished` to `activationEvents` so the icon always renders; added a `viewsWelcome` empty-state message explaining the tool looks for `manage.py` / `models.py`, with quick actions to open a folder, refresh the scan, or read docs on GitHub. Django auto-activation on those files is unchanged.

## [0.3.5] + [py-1.0.11] - 2026-07-15

Combined release — Django 5.2 support, cascade blast-radius preview for AI agents, and a reverse-references sidebar action. Feature-set derived from a competitive analysis of `meshy/django-schema-graph` (stale since 2023, Django ≤ 4.1) and MCP peers (`gts360/django-mcp-server`, `kitespark/django-mcp`) — all of which require a running Django process; django-orm-lens keeps the zero-runtime moat.

### Added
- **Django 5.2 support** — new `Framework :: Django :: 5.2` classifier and a CI matrix job (`python-cli`) that runs pytest against Python 3.10-3.12 × Django 4.2-5.2 in parallel with the existing Node/TS build.
- **`cascade_preview` MCP tool** — new tool `cascade_preview(app_label, model_name)` returns inbound relations grouped by `on_delete` behavior into `cascade_kills` / `set_null` / `protected` buckets. Lets AI agents preview a delete's blast radius before acting, using only static parse (no DB, no boot).
- **`on_delete` on inbound relations** — `find_relations` inbound entries now include the `on_delete` value (`CASCADE`, `SET_NULL`, `PROTECT`, `SET_DEFAULT`, `DO_NOTHING`, `RESTRICT`, or `SET` for callable form) extracted via the existing parser helper.
- **VS Code: "Find Reverse References" context action** — right-click any model in the sidebar tree → `Find Reverse References` → QuickPick of every FK/OneToOne/M2M pointing at this model, using the in-memory workspace index (no re-parse).
- **`[full]` optional-dependencies alias** — `pip install "django-orm-lens[full]"` is now equivalent to `[mcp]`; documents the default install as zero-dependency in a pyproject header comment.

### Changed
- **README hero** — added `Works offline. Works on a broken venv. Works on someone else's laptop. Works in CI.` positioning line under the problem section.
- **README comparison table** — added Django version support row (ours 4.0-5.2 · schema-graph 3.2-4.1 stale since 2023 · django-extensions latest) with an explicit stale-since-2023 note for `django-schema-graph`.

## [0.3.4] + [py-1.0.10] - 2026-07-15

Combined release — the parser hardening ships identically in both the VS Code extension and the Python CLI. Product of a 3-round security + stability + type-design + Django-semantics audit.

### Added
- **`on_delete=models.SET(default_value)` callable form now recognised** — previous regex `[A-Z][A-Z_]+` matched only bare identifiers (`CASCADE`, `SET_NULL`, `PROTECT`, etc.) and silently dropped the callable form used to inject a default value on delete. Parser now falls back to matching `on_delete=SET(` and records `"SET"`, so consumers know the field has a dynamic on_delete rather than treating it as absent.

### Security
- **ReDoS clamp on class-indent detection** — `_detect_class_indent` now clamps the reported indent width to 32 and expands tabs to width 4 before use. A crafted `models.py` with an absurd number of leading spaces (10k+) or a tab that produced a width-mismatched regex could previously build patterns like `\s{20000,}` for the meta-body match and trigger catastrophic backtracking. Fixes both the ReDoS vector and the tab-indent correctness bug (Meta blocks in tab-indented codebases were silently unparsed).

### Fixed
- **Workspace scan no longer aborts on a single broken `models.py`** — `scan_workspace` (Python CLI) and `scanWorkspace` (VS Code extension) previously wrapped both the read AND the parse in one broad try/catch. A parser exception in a single file (e.g. missing `(` after a matched field, malformed multi-line class header) would either abort the whole workspace scan with exit 1 (Python) or silently drop that file's models from the tree (TypeScript). Now the read and parse are caught separately: parse errors log a per-file warning to stderr (Python) or dev-tools console (TypeScript) and scanning continues on the next file.
- **Multi-line class header parser no longer near-loops on malformed signatures** — `_read_multiline_class` used to return `None` when parens closed but the joined buffer didn't match `CLASS_RE`. The caller would then advance by only one line, causing every continuation line of a malformed wrap to be re-evaluated as a potential class header. Now returns `(None, end_index)` so the caller skips past the whole section.
- **`_read_balanced_args` guard for missing `(`** — if a matched field somehow doesn't have `(` on its starting line, `.index("(")` used to raise `ValueError` that propagated out of `parse_models_file` and aborted the entire scan. Now returns an empty args block and the field is captured with no relation metadata.
- **Message handler disposable leak in the ER-diagram webview** — `panel.webview.onDidReceiveMessage(...)` registered its subscription in `context.subscriptions`, but the handler is scoped to the panel's lifetime, not the extension's. Every close/reopen of the diagram panel appended a dead listener to `context.subscriptions` forever. Handler now scoped to the panel's `onDidDispose` cleanup.
- **Watcher listener leak on `autoRefresh` config change + split-module files not watched** — `setupWatcher` disposed the old watcher on config toggle but left the three `onDidChange/Create/Delete` listeners registered in `context.subscriptions` permanently, firing against a disposed watcher. Now tracks a module-level `watcherDisposables` array that fully disposes before re-registering. Same pass also adds a second watcher for `**/models/*.py` — split-module Django apps' sub-files now trigger auto-refresh on save (previously ignored, tree silently went stale on those files).
- **Model-name collision in filtered tree** — two models sharing a name in different apps (a valid Django pattern) collided in the filtered-tree child lookup because identity was matched by `label + kind` only. Now also compares `filePath`, so children resolve to the correct model.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-07-13

### Security
- **Mermaid bundled locally instead of fetched from a CDN** — the ER-diagram webview now loads `mermaid.min.js` from a vendored copy at `media/vendor/`. The `script-src` CSP no longer allows `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net`, and `localResourceRoots` restricts the webview to files under `media/`. Removes a third-party network dependency, works offline, and eliminates supply-chain risk from the CDN.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-13

### Security
- **`jumpToModel` workspace check hardened** — the previous manual `.toLowerCase()` prefix comparison was Windows-oriented and could false-positive on case-sensitive filesystems (Linux). Switched to `vscode.workspace.getWorkspaceFolder(uri)`, which VS Code resolves with OS-appropriate case handling. Simpler code, correct on every platform.

## [py-1.0.9] - 2026-07-14

Python package only. VS Code extension unchanged at 0.3.3.

### Added
- **Subtle star ask in the welcome output** — `django-orm-lens` (no args) now closes with a two-line invitation to star the repo if the tool saved a search. Rationale: 134 unique cloners on the 14-day traffic window converted to only 2 stars — infrastructure tools bleed stars silently because users never revisit the repo after `pip install`. A single sentence at the point of first-run gratitude is the smallest touch that closes the loop without becoming spam. No CLI behaviour change.

## [py-1.0.8] - 2026-07-13

Python package only. VS Code extension unchanged at 0.3.3.

### Added
- **Friendly welcome when `django-orm-lens` runs without a subcommand** — previously bare invocation printed a cryptic `argparse: the following arguments are required: command` error, killing the pip-install-and-poke-around funnel. Now shows a compact commands table + docs link so a new user immediately sees what to try next.

## [py-1.0.7] - 2026-07-13

Python package only. VS Code extension unchanged at 0.3.1.

### Added
- **Mermaid ER edge labels — Python ↔ TypeScript parity** — `django-orm-lens er` and the MCP `er_diagram` tool now emit the same `on_delete`, `through`, and `related_name` metadata as the VS Code diagram. Example: `Book }o--|| Author : "author [CASCADE, as books]"` and `Book }o--o{ Tag : "tags [through BookTag]"`. Previously the Python side stripped all metadata to just the field name.
- **MCP index cache (30s TTL)** — agents chaining multiple tool calls (`list_apps` → `describe_model` → `find_relations`) no longer re-walk the filesystem and re-parse every `models.py` per call. Cache keyed by workspace root; short TTL keeps manual edits visible.

## [py-1.0.6] - 2026-07-13

Python package only. VS Code extension unchanged at 0.3.1.

### Changed
- **MCP tool error semantics** — `describe_model` and `find_relations` now raise `ValueError` on missing-model instead of returning a `"error: ..."` string. FastMCP maps this to a protocol-level `isError: true` response, so MCP-compatible agents recognize it as a tool error rather than a successful call with error text.

### Fixed
- **Parser perf** — `_read_balanced_args` was building the args buffer with per-char `str += ch` inside a nested loop (quadratic on multi-line field bodies). Now uses a list + single `"".join`.

## [py-1.0.5] - 2026-07-13

Hotfix release. Python package only. VS Code extension unchanged at 0.3.1.

### Fixed
- **Crash on `ManyToManyField(through=...)`** — `_extract_through_model` was called from `parse_models_file` but never defined, and `through_model` was assigned on `ParsedField` without a matching dataclass field. Any Django project with an M2M `through=` argument would raise `NameError` / `AttributeError` and return an empty index. Both are now declared. Discovered by QA sweep of 1.0.4 with type-design and Python reviewers.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **`throughModel` on the M2M edge** — Mermaid ER diagrams now render `through=` on `ManyToManyField` relations, e.g. `authors [through Authorship]`. First-time external contribution by [@kingrubic](https://github.com/kingrubic) in [#5](https://github.com/FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens/pull/5).
- **Listed on [Glama.ai MCP directory](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens)** — third discovery channel alongside VS Code Marketplace and the official MCP Registry.

## [py-1.0.4] - 2026-07-13

Python package parity release. Extension bumped in parallel to 0.3.1.

### Added
- **`through_model` on `ParsedField`** — Python parser now extracts `through=` from `ManyToManyField(...)` and emits `"throughModel": "..."` in JSON. Matches the TypeScript port field-for-field.

## [py-1.0.3] - 2026-07-13

Python package only. VS Code extension unchanged at 0.3.0.

### Added
- **Listed in the official [MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/)** — the server is now discoverable through the canonical Model Context Protocol directory. MCP-compatible clients can find it by name (`io.github.FROWNINGdev/django-orm-lens`).
- `cli/server.json` — MCP Registry metadata (PyPI package, stdio transport, uvx runtime hint).
- Ownership-verification marker in `cli/README.md` (hidden HTML comment) so the registry can prove the PyPI package is ours.

### Fixed
- 1.0.1: added `on_delete` and `related_name` extraction — kept for parity with the VS Code extension.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-13

Ships the terminal + AI-agent story and a batch of ER-diagram / editor polish.

### Added
- **Python CLI + MCP server** — companion package `django-orm-lens` on PyPI. Zero-dep CLI (`scan`, `describe`, `hover`, `list`, `er`) and an optional MCP stdio server exposing five read-only tools to Cursor, Aider, Continue.dev, Zed, and any MCP client. Install: `pip install "django-orm-lens[mcp]"`.
- **CodeLens above every model class** — shows field count, relation count, and an "Open ER diagram" action. Toggle with `djangoOrmLens.showCodeLens`.
- **Edge labels on the ER diagram** — relation arrows now include `on_delete` (CASCADE / SET_NULL / PROTECT) and `related_name` when present, e.g. `author [CASCADE, as posts]`.
- **Diagram theme picker** — `djangoOrmLens.diagramTheme` accepts `auto` (default, follows VS Code theme), `default`, `dark`, `forest`, and `neutral`.

### Fixed
- CI publish workflow was silently failing because of a YAML quoting bug — restored to green; adds a parallel PyPI publish job.

### Docs
- README rewritten around three surfaces: VS Code extension, Python CLI, and MCP server. New Integrations table, updated roadmap, and Support section.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-15

The polish release. Consolidates hover, filter, welcome, security hardening, and diagram export into a single minor bump.

### Added
- **Export ER diagram as SVG** — new button in the diagram panel header saves the rendered graph to a file inside your workspace.
- **Welcome view** — when no Django models are found, the sidebar now shows a friendly explanation and a Refresh action instead of a blank panel.
- **Smart tree expansion** — apps start expanded on small projects (<= 40 models) and collapsed on larger ones; a filter always expands to reveal matches.
- **Multi-line class inheritance** — the parser now handles Black-formatted classes where the base list wraps across two or three lines.

### Security
- **jumpToModel path scoping** — the jump command now rejects any target outside the current workspaceFolders. Prevents a crafted models.py from opening arbitrary local files.
- **Hover markdown sanitization** — parser-derived strings are escaped and the trusted-command scope is narrowed to djangoOrmLens.jumpToModel only. Blocks command-URI injection through model or field names.

### Docs

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Filter tree** — new sidebar buttons and command palette actions (`Django ORM Lens: Filter Models`, `Clear Filter`) let you type a substring and narrow the tree to matching apps, models, and fields in real time. Parent nodes stay visible when a descendant matches.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Hover cards** over `ForeignKey('app.Model')`, `OneToOneField(...)`, and `ManyToManyField(...)` references. Hovering a related-model string in the editor now shows a preview of that model (fields, relations, base classes) and a one-click jump link.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- Support for split `models/` package directories (multi-file apps).
- Support for bare field imports (`from django.db.models import CharField`).
- Output channel "Django ORM Lens" for surfaced scan errors.

### Fixed
- Parser now detects indentation width per class instead of assuming 4 spaces (2-space codebases were showing zero fields).
- False-positive base-class detection: `ModelAdmin`, `ModelSerializer`, `ModelForm`, `ResponseModel`, and similar classes are no longer treated as database models.
- Race condition in the workspace scanner: concurrent saves could leave stale results in the tree.
- `Jump to Model` crashed when the target file had been deleted between scan and click — now shows a warning and refreshes.

### Security
- Webview nonce is now generated via `crypto.randomBytes` instead of `Math.random()`.
- Mermaid CDN reference pinned to `10.9.4` (was floating on `mermaid@10`).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- Initial release.
- Sidebar TreeView grouping apps → models → fields → Meta.
- Field-type-aware icons for CharField, ForeignKey, ManyToManyField, and 20+ built-ins.
- Mermaid-rendered ER diagram in a side webview panel.
- Jump-to-definition on any tree node.
- Auto-refresh via `models.py` file watcher.
- Configurable exclude globs (defaults skip `migrations/`, `venv/`, `node_modules/`).
- Status-bar item showing scanned model count.
